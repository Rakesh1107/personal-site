            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>I was born on 11th July, 1998 in Karaikudi. I did my primary schooling at Indian School Al Wadi Al Kabir, Muscat, Oman & secondary schooling at Alagappa Matric. Hr. Sec. School, Karaikudi. I'm pursuing my degree "Bachelor of Engineering" on "Electronics & Communication Engineering" at Park College of Engineering & Technology, Coimbatore. I love playing cricket & music besides programming.</p>
            <p>I started to learn coding during the 2nd year of my college. I knew it was not early to start coding but I made up my mind that this is my future & I tried to learn the basics of every language I came across. Then I realized that there is no point in learning too many languages without even knowing the purpose. I feared that I may become an example of"Jack of all trades, master of none"</p>
            <p>As soon as I realized this, I decided to choose a particular path for me in the vast field of technology. I decided to learn Web development & started learning HTML, CSS(I know they are not programming languages) on Youtube. Then, I took the online course "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp" from Udemy. It covered everything from HTML, CSS, JavaScript to SQL, Node.js, Express, React.js, MongoDB & more. Now, I can say that I'm a junior Web developer even though I haven't got a job yet but I'm sure to get one soon. I'm looking for freelancing projects to build my resume. You can contact me anytime you want. I assure you that i will work true to my heart & for your satisfaction. Have a great day! â˜•</p>
